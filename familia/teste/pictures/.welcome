Hello

I'm the <b>.welcome</b> file located in your pictures directory !
You can edit my content online once you're loggued-in as admin.

Here is a basic install validation procedure:

1/ Log-in as admin
2/ Try to create a directory
3/ Try to upload a file (either via the web interface or via your FTP client)
4/ See if the thumbnail get correctly generated

Once all this is working, please edit me and put whatever you want here.

<div style="border: solid 1px; width: 50%; padding: 5px;"><u>Tip:</u>
Here is an example of HTML use, you can create links like one to see the <a href="?toprated=1">top rated pictures</a> or include pictures using img links.
</div>
